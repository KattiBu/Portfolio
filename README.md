# About me
My name is Katarzyna Burdyńska. I am Master of Engineering. I graduated from Gdańsk University of Technology. 
During my parental leave, I became interested in software testing. My goal is to develop my testing knowledge and gain practical experience.
On this site I would like to share my all gained experience from personal studies.
